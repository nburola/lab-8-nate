salmon_2

#Describing the relationship between salmon imports and years with a linear regression makes sense as there is a relatively linear increase over time, not an exponential one similair to bacteria. Salmon imports will vary from year to year making sense for a linear regression to be performed. The only concern I would have is the possibility of outliers influencing the data tremendously. 
```

```{r}
salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)

salmon_model

#Based on Linear Regression function, the function would be y = -15059597 + 7588x (Imports = tons = -400 + 25(Year)
#Slope: As x (number of years) increases by 1, the y value (salmon imports per 1000) will increase by 7588 (1000 pounds)
#Y-Intercept: At year 0, there is -15059597 (1000 pounds) of salmon 
#Y-intercept is concerning as it is a negative big value compared to the postive y values of salmon imports per 1000 pounds making it extremely diffucult if not downright impossible to predict past previous values. You can't predict previous values with a negative y intercept 
```

```{r}
par(mfrow= c(2,2))
plot(salmon_model)

#Resdiuals appear to be randomly distributed around the gray horizontal dashed line making the assumption of homoscedastictic not violated 
#Normal QQ-Plot sow all of the dots above the gray dash horizontal line making it normally distrubuted 
#Outliers are present in Residauls vs Leverage and are outside of Cook's Distance (Point 24 and Point 28) meaning they are influencing the data
